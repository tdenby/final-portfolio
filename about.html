        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <aside><p> I'm a second-year master's student at the University of Michigan
            studying user experience design and research. I have a background
            in understanding human behavior, having studied cognitive science
            as an undergrad. I love problem-solving and working with others!
            When I'm not designing, I enjoy a variety of hobbies, including;
            playing videogames, playing guitar, going to music shows, and being a
            tv/movie snob. Growing up, you could have witnessed me doing nearly
            a dozen different musicals, and so although I no longer do theater,
            I still am very passionate about music. I also am passionate about
            cooperative living, having lived in a coop for 4 years now.
            Finally, I have 3 pet rats that I love!
        </p>

        <p> I've been an avid tech fan since I was little, constantly reading
            about the newest tech products and tinkering with any software
            application that I found interesting. When Google released its
            first Material Design guidelines, I became enamored with design,
            and it became my mission to learn how to make aesthetically-pleasing
            and easy-to-use designs! I've been using my time at the University of
            Michigan's MSI program to learn all I can, from different coding languages to
            research methods and advanced graphic design principles. I've
            even gotten to use some of these skills volunteering on the marketing
            team of the Inter-Cooperative Council of Ann Arbor.
